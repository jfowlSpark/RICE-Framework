## Overview

**RICE** stands for **Role, Instruction, Context, and Examples** — a simple, reliable framework for crafting structured prompts that help language models perform complex reasoning and produce consistent, contextually aligned outputs.

I developed RICE in 2023 as part of my research into effective AI prompting.  
This repository publishes the framework under an **open-source MIT License** to ensure it remains freely available for learning, adaptation, and professional use.

## The RICE Framework

1. **Role** – Define the perspective or expertise you want the AI to assume.  
   *Example: “You are an expert data scientist specializing in insurance analytics.”*

2. **Instruction** – Clearly describe the task or goal.  
   *Example: “Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised models.”*

3. **Context** – Provide any relevant background or constraints.  
   *Example: “This explanation will be used in a training guide for new analysts.”*

4. **Examples** – Supply patterns or sample outputs for consistency.  
   *Example: “Format your response as bullet points with concise definitions.”*

## Purpose of Publication

The purpose of open-sourcing this framework is to:
- Protect its authorship and maintain transparency around its origin.
- Encourage responsible and creative use in education, training, and research.
- Prevent misuse or proprietary claims that would restrict others.
